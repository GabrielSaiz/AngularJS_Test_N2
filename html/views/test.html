							You are about to start performing the technical test that Ricoh proposes for the recruitment of Angularjs developers.
						</p>
						<p>					
							This test consists of 4 independent tests consisting of the development of a table, the development of a form, the development of a summary panel and implement multilanguage.
							These four tests are thoroughly explained in the following tabs.
						</p>
						<p>
						The quality and result of this test will have an important weight of decision that the group of evaluators take when evaluating your candidacy to be part of our team.
						</p>
						<p>
						We are aware that the test can be difficult to face depending on the personal situation of the evaluated, since it is extensive and will take much of your free time. But the compensation will be directly proportional to its result, so we ask for an extra effort to the evaluated that will be rewarded.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, in case of any doubt in the realization of this test, get in touch with our team and we will solve it as quickly as possible.
						</p>
						<p>Sincerely, Sergio Cernuda Fdez angularJs developer on Ricoh.</p>

				      <h2 class="center">Test 1</h3>
				        <h3>Make a Form</h3>
				      	<p>		      
							Make a form that simulates inserting an object in the json hosted in "/resources/data/data.json".
						</p>

							Create all the necessary fields in the form for the simulation and treat them correctly from the controller.
						</p>
						<p>				
							After this you have two options
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Show the object on the same form screen</li>
							<li>Show the object by console</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The form will be inserted in a new tab that you will have to create in the side menu with the correct configuration and using the ui-router library for navigation.

						<h3>1.a Make a table with desktop computers.</h3>
				      	<p>
							Make a table of desktop computers with the information attached to the Json with path "/resources/data/data.json".

				      	<h3>Make a data summary panel</h3>
				      	<p>
							In this section we propose the realization of a summary panel with the information provided within the data json.
							It can be the typical panel of general information that a user of administrator type would see as a summary,
						</p>
						<p>					
							For this section we do not put any kind of precondition, we let you choose both the design and the functionality of this screen, as long as it is consistent with the rest of the application.
